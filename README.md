** Super Market Sales Analysis - Power BI

As part of my ongoing efforts to analyze and optimize retail performance, I worked on this supermarket sales analysis project, focusing on key sales and customer data.

Problem Statement
The supermarket chain has been experiencing fluctuations in revenue and profit across various product categories. In order to better understand the factors contributing to these changes, the management sought detailed insights into product sales, customer behavior, and overall performance metrics.

Task List
As the data analyst for this project, I was provided with sales data and tasked with the following:

Dashboard Creation: Develop a comprehensive dashboard that provides an overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) like total unit price, quantity sold, gross income, tax, and customer segmentation.
Insights Generation: Analyze the performance of various product categories, payment types, and customer segments to derive actionable insights for decision-making.
Customer Segmentation: Identify sales trends across customer types and payment methods to help management optimize their strategies.
Data Model
I utilized data from product categories, payment methods, sales amounts, customer demographics, and store performance. This data was then modeled to highlight sales trends and operational costs, segmented by different variables such as customer type and product line.

Overall Analysis View

Unit Price & Quantity: The total unit price was 17.16K, with 2K units sold.
Gross Income & Tax: The supermarket generated 4.63K in gross income, with an equivalent tax amount of 4.63K.
Cost Breakdown: Total cost amounted to 97.22K, and the cost of goods sold (COGS) was distributed across customer types with 48K for members and 45K for non-members.
Segmentation of Payment
Analyzing the payment methods, 36.96% of customers used cash, followed by 33.33% opting for credit cards, and 29.7% using e-wallets.

Insights

Top-selling Product Lines: Fashion accessories and food & beverages lead in terms of total unit prices, contributing 3.7K and 3.4K, respectively.
Cost Efficiency: Home & lifestyle items displayed a balanced cost-to-sales ratio, while fashion accessories, despite high sales, showed slightly higher costs.
Payment Trends: The use of cash remains dominant, but credit card usage shows potential for future growth.
Learnings from the Project

Explored advanced Power BI features such as matrix visuals to break down sales performance by product lines.
Implemented color consistency and themes to maintain a professional and easy-to-read dashboard format.
Applied data-driven decision-making techniques to identify underperforming product lines and potential areas for cost reduction.
Important Insights from the Dashboard

Electronic accessories had the highest sales volume with 313 units sold, followed by food and beverages at 349 units.
Fashion accessories led in terms of revenue, but their cost-to-sales ratio was less efficient compared to other categories.
The "credit card" payment method shows potential for expansion, with room to increase its market share.
This analysis equips the supermarket management with data-backed insights for improving sales strategies, optimizing product lines, and enhancing customer experience.
